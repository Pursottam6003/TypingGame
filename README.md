### Description of Game

In this game  I had explored how events work in JavaScript. My game is going to test a player's typing skill, which is one of the most underrated skills all developers should have. We should all be practicing our typing! The general flow of the game will look like this:

- Player clicks on start button and is presented with a quote to type
- Player types the quote as quickly as they can in a textbox
  - As each word is completed, the next one is highlighted
  - If the player has a typo, the textbox is updated to red
  - When the player completes the quote, a success message is displayed with the elapsed time


### File structure

> There are three total files: **index.html**, **typing2.js** and **typingstyle.css**. and other images that we had used in dark-light theme.
> This also have dark and light mode for user better experience 
> The colours are selected in that manner that colorblind person can also play this game 
> Better user animation and soon implement some more features in this application 
> At the end of this game it will shows your mistakes as well as Time taken and most importantly your accuracy ⭐😊 
> Thank You
